Marketing design with a particular focus on the branding and digital presence for Connected, a rapidly growing product development firm in Toronto.

Connected’s website and brand went through two design iterations while I was working there. For the first iteration for then [Connected Lab](http://cl-staging.webflow.io/), I designed an all new careers page in collaboration with creative director [Greg Washington](http://www.gregwashington.ca/). This page features a unique new ticker element, meant to show the abundance and variety of internal events that Connected hosts.

When [Connected](https://www.connected.io/) finally [rebranded in August 2018](http://underlinestudio.com/connected/), I designed the blog, events, careers pages in collaboration with [Underline](http://underlinestudio.com/). Both websites were developed entirely by me in Webflow.

At Connected I also spearheaded the creation of a end-to-end design and development project, [Wild Combination Digital](/experiments/2018/08/21/wild-combination.html). Wild Combination is a rapid ideation card game where participants apply technologies to real-life scenarios to create novel solutions. This project adapted the original card game into the digital space, allowing users to participate and collaborate on civic tech problems from anywhere in the world. [Prototypes](https://cl-wildcombination.netlify.com/) were developed in React and tested at [Civic Tech Toronto](http://civictech.ca/).

I also founded XR Club, a internal cross-disciplinary club meant to bolster the creation of spatial computing projects (AR/VR/MR) at Connected. My role as president was to organize events and speakers, design graphics, and send out communication internally. With XR Club I’ve personally hosted a Unity 101 tutorial and a presentation on traversal in VR, but we’ve also hosted talks on prototyping, XR build pipelines, and more.
