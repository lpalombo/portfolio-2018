GenArt2Go is a travelling art project where I create and sell unique algorithmically generated artwork. All of the art is printed on the fly while exhibiting using my custom built 3D printer turned pen plotter.

This project was initially created for the Ontario Science Centreâ€™s [Tech Art Fair](https://www.ontariosciencecentre.ca/TechArtFair/). Here, I exhibited my custom pen plotter and handed out small samples to children and parents as they stopped by my table. For this exhibition the art was generated using a custom processing sketch based on a [perlin noise flow field algorithm](https://davenewt.github.io/perlin-noise-flow-field/). Because of the algorithmic nature of the code, customers could pay to design their own pieces and have them printed on-site with their own choice of pens and inks.
