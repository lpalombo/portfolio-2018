Marketing design with a particular focus on the branding and digital presence for Connected, a rapidly growing product development firm in Toronto.

Connectedâ€™s website and brand went through two design iterations while I was working there. For the first iteration for then [Connected Lab](http://cl-staging.webflow.io/), I designed an all new careers page in collaboration with creative director [Greg Washington](http://www.gregwashington.ca/). This page features a unique new ticker element, meant to show the abundance and variety of internal events that Connected hosts.

When [Connected](https://www.connected.io/) finally [rebranded in August 2018](http://underlinestudio.com/connected/), I designed the blog, events, careers pages in collaboration with [Underline](http://underlinestudio.com/). Both websites were developed entirely by me in Webflow.
