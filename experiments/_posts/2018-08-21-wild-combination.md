Wild Combination is a rapid ideation card game where participants apply technologies to real-life scenarios to create novel solutions. This experiment is a prototype for Wild Combination Digital, an initiative to adapt the original card game into the digital space, allowing users to participate in ideation exercises from anywhere in the world. 

This prototype was created during my time at [Connected](/projects/2019/01/01/connected.html) as an exercise to learn React and other modern web and general software development technology such as SASS, ES6, Firebase, and version control.
