Fluidity is an interactive installation created at the [ChangeUp Art+Tech Jam](http://changeup.io/) and is a joint project with creative technologist [Yuma Yanagisawa](https://yumayanagisawa.com/).

Fluidity capitalizes on advancements in real-time 3D graphics to create an interactive installation that juxtaposes abstract form with nature.

For this project I was mainly in charge of the physical interface of the installation. For the final installation I created a free standing sphere interface with a handmade capacitive sensor built-in. When users put their hands close to the sphere, a sphere reflected in the 3D scene would react accordingly.
