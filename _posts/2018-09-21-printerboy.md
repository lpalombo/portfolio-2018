PrinterBoy is a hypothetical product that playfully bridges the gap between the most fun aspects of the digital and print worlds.

It takes the form of a small internet-connected thermal receipt printer that spits out a curated feed of paper-centric toys and games every single day. 

A companion app lets you treat PrinterBoy like an instant printer, allowing you to send customized selfies and images to your friends around the globe. PrinterBoy is designed to be a system that can grow and adapt to a community of developers and makers.
